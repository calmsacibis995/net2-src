formatting system. The version number is given in the file VERSION.

In order to use these, you must also have a copy of the groff source
distribution with exactly the same version.  You will not need a C++
compiler (or indeed any other compiler).

To install groff, edit the Makefile in this directory and type `make'.
You shouldn't need to change the Makefile in the source directory.
