GNU C++ User Survey:

By strictly controlling distribution, vendors of proprietary software
know who their clients are.  Writers of free software cannot use this
technique to learn the composition of their clientel, and therefore
must often work only on intuition.  Please help us get out of the dark
by answering this survey, so that we know better what resouces are
most needed and how they can be best applied.  If you make free
software available to others, please help us by asking them to also
take the time to answer this survey.

	1. Which GNU products do you use?  For what applications?
	   What do you like about them?

	2. How did you hear about GNU software

	3. Do you know people who won't use it?
	   Why don't they?

	4. What drawbacks do you see with GNU software?
	   What would make them better?

Any comments about issues related to using GNU software (support,
documentation, etc) or any other comments?
