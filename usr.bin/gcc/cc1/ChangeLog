	* out-mips.c (init_cumulative_args, function_arg_advance,
	function_arg, function_arg_partial_nregs): Type CUMULATIVE_ARGS is
	now a pointer to a structure instead of a structure.  New field
	arg_words tracks number of words consumed so far and arg_number just
	tracks physical numbers of arguments.  Make four single precision
	floating point arguments passed via prototypes use $f12, $f14, $6,
	and $7, just like mips cc.

	* tm-mips.h (INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS, FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE,
	FUNCTION_ARG, FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS): Type CUMULATIVE_ARGS is

Tue Nov 27 12:28:45 1990  Michael Meissner  (meissner at osf.org)

	* out-mips.c (function_arg, function_arg_advance): Pass single
	precision floating point numbers to prototyped functions by assuming
	only one word is passed rather than two unless the argument is
	passed in a floating point register.  This behavior matches the MIPS
	C compiler.

	* tm-mips.h (CPP_SPEC): Add -D_MIPSEB -D_SYSTYPE_SYSV -D_LANGUAGE_C
	to SGI's CPP_SPEC.
	(MIPS_DEBUGGING_INFO): New macro.
	(PUT_SDB_*): Write debug information to the temporary file that
	buffers the text section, instead of using the current output file.

	* tm-iris.h (CPP_PREDEFINES): Move -D_LANGUAGE_C from CPP_PREDEFINES
	to CPP_SPEC since it's in the compiler name space, -ansi should not
	disable it.

Mon Nov 26 18:37:39 1990  Michael Meissner  (meissner at osf.org)

	* mips.md (stack compressor peephole): Remove check against
	stack_args_preallocated, since nobody sets it.
	(anonymous add/subtract patterns): Explicitly use the assembler
	temporary register if adding/subtracting a constant that won't fit
	in 16 bits -- Silicon Graphics asm complains.
	(fix_truncdfsi2, fix_truncsfsi2) Rewrite so that optimization of
	repeated conversions of the same number do not generate an insn not
	found error message (the generated insn was optimized to a gp->gp
	register move inside of a parallel with a clobber of a hard fp
	register).  The new insns describe the machine more faithfully, and
	allow things like clobbering the fp register containing the value,
	if it is the last use rather than using a specific hard register.
	(fixuns_truncsfsi2, fixuns_truncdfsi2): New patterns to
	automatically convert {single,double} precision to unsigned.
	(anonymous move df/sf patterns): Put the operands to mfc1 in the
	order the assembler likes them (always put gp reg first, even if
	moving from gp register to fp register).
	(wild_insn): Remove bogus insn which is commented out.
	(jump): Remove TARGET_PIC code for now.

	* out-mips.c (toplevel, function_epilogue, mips_asm_file_end,
	mips_output_external): If optimizing for the global pointer, emit
	all code after processing the entire program, rather than emitting
	the code at the end of the function.  Also, properly sized .extern's
	are emitted for variables that are not defined in the current
	module.  This is because the MIPS assembler uses single pass
	semantics, and will emit a 2 instruction sequence for externals it
	doesn't know anything about, and GCC emits data definitions at the
	end of the program.  You can't just emit a properly sized .extern
	either, because the assembler will complain if it sees an .extern
	followed by a definition.  The ADDRESSABLE bit in the identifier
	node for the external name is used to indicate whether a definition
	for the name exists or not.  This replaces code which told the
	assembler to preprocess the source, and include the same source
	twice.
	(sym_lineno): Add a new variable to keep trace of labels emitted
	after each .loc for Silicon Graphics.
	(function_prologue, function_epilogue, toplevel): Explicitly use
	temporary registers for stack frames > 32K, since the Silicon
	Graphics system doesn't automatically use $at if the value overflows,
	also save an instruction or two for large stack frames.
	(init_cumulative_args): Fix to work with the method types G++
	produces as well as normal function types.
	(compare_collect): In debug code, print the mode symbolically.
	(trace): Take two additional arguments which are passed to fprintf.
	(override_options): Remove unsupported -mpic code.

	* tm-decstatn.h (toplevel): Add a GNU copyright.

	* tm-iris.h (toplevel): Add a GNU copyright.
	(CPP_SPEC): If -ansi, define __EXTENSIONS__.
	(SGI_TARGET): Define this for other mips files.
	(LABEL_AFTER_LOC): New macro to put a label after .loc.
	(SET_FILE_NUMBER): New macro to force .file/.loc file # to be 1.
	(ADJUST_STACK_SIZE): Don't deal with variable arguments.

	* tm-mips.h (*_SPEC): Add #ifdef's so other files can define their
	own, without #undef.
	(LINK_SPEC, ASM_SPEC): Pass -EB/-EL to assembler, linker so cross
	compilers can be made from little endian mips to big endian mips and
	vica versa.  Generate an error message if the wrong flag is used.
	Do not pass -EB/-EL to Silicon Graphics assembler/linker.
	(CPP_SPEC, MACHINE_NAME): Add Silicon Graphics defaults.
	(MIPS_TEMP?_REGNUM): New macros for temporary registers used in the
	prologue and epilogue if the stack frame is > 32K.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL): If optimizing the global pointer, set the
	addressable bit in the indentifier node, so that mips_asm_file_end
	and mips_output_external can figure out if a particular identifier
	really is external to the compiliation unit.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON): Same change as ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL): Same change as ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL.
	(MACHINE_TYPE): Key off of OSF_OS and SGI_TARGET macros.
	(TARGET_DEFAULT): For OSF/1 make -mgas and -G 0 default.
	(STACK_POINTER_OFFSET): Define as 0.
	(external variables): Declare flag_omit_frame_pointer,
	sdb_label_count, mips_section_threshold, and sym_lineno.
	(STACK_ARGS_ADJUST): Protect with an #ifndef.
	(FUNCTION_PROFILER): Talk to the MIPS profiling routines the same
	way the MIPS compiler does.
	(INDIRECTABLE_ADDRESS_P): Allow disp+reg in addition to reg+disp.
	(ASM_FILE_START): If optimizing for the global pointer, create a
	temporay stream to hold text until program ends.  Put gcc_compiled.
	in the data section.
	(ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME): Switch file streams used to the text
	stream if optimizing for the global pointer.
	(ASM_FILE_END): New macro to invoke mips_asm_file_end function.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE): Invoke macro LABEL_AFTER_LOC after .loc,
	so that Silicon Graphics can put out a label after each .loc.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME): Invoke macro SET_FILE_NUMBER to set
	the file number, so Silicon Graphics can hardwire this to 1.
	(LABEL_AFTER_LOC, SET_FILE_NUMBER): Provide defaults if not Silicon
	Graphics.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII): Assign parameter to local variable, and remove
	special \a, \v support.
	(ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT): Dump #ident directives into .data.

Tue Aug 21 20:03:51 1990  Michael Meissner  (meissner at osf.org)

	* Makefile (install): Add code to build libg.a if it doesn't exist
	when installing GCC.

	* out-mips.c (toplevel): add external declaration for asm_out_file,
	and 2 new FILE *'s (asm_out_data_file, asm_out_text_file) so we can
	switch between two files when optimizing for the global pointer.
	Also add a structure type to hold the linked list of externs that
	GCC wishes to emit.

	Everything between the function prologue and epilogue are written to
	a temporary file, which is written to the normal output file after
	the entire program is processed.  This is needed because the MIPS
	assembler assumes that all externals should be referenced with a 2
	instruction sequence instead of the faster 1 instruction sequence
	off of the GP, unless a proper .extern proceeds any use.  We can't
	emit the .extern because the assembler will complain if later there
	is a definition for the variable, such as GCC puts out at the end of
	the program.

	(compare_collect): print mode symbolically in debug code.

	(mips_output_external): Remove code which used the preprocessor to
	handle the global pointer, and remember all externs in a linked list
	for use at the end of the program.

	(mips_asm_file_end): If optimizing the global pointer, emit all
	externals which don't have definitions as the appropriate sized
	.extern, and then emit the code for functions that was written to a
	temporary file, so that the code comes after the appropriate
	definition or declaration.

	(function_epilogue): If optimizing for the global pointer, switch
	the current output file to the data file after all of the epilogue
	is written out.

	* tm-mips.h (ASM_SPEC): Duplicate ASM_SPEC into 2 #ifdef sections (one
	for the little endian DECstation, and the other for everybody else
	who uses the MIPS in a big endian mode), and pass the appropriate
	-EL and -EB switches to the assembler.  This allows building a cross
	compiler for a different endian MIPS.

	(LINK_SPEC): Pass -EL and -EB to linker, just like ASM_SPEC.

	(MACHINE_TYPE): For DECstation, specify "Ultrix Dec Mips" instead of
	just "Dec Mips".

	(FUNCTION_PROFILER): Call _mcount in the appropriate MIPS fashion.

	(ASM_FILE_START): If optimizing for the global pointer, open a
	temporary file to write the code to (see out-mips.c above).

	(ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME): If optimizing for the global pointer,
	switch the current output file to asm_out_text_file.

	(ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON): Remove the old code which used the preprocessor
	to optimize for the global pointer.

	* stmt.c (assign_parms): Likewise.
	* integrate.c (function_cannot_inline_p): Likewise.

	* STACK_ARGS_ADJUST: Arg is now a `struct arg_data' and it should
	be updated in place.
	* tm-mips.h: Define it.
	* expr.c (expand_call): Adapt to this.  Assume padding comes after args
	so turn off the feature of changing the args' offsets.
	(emit_library_call): Adapt to this.

	Truncate SFmode constants to single precision.

	If there is one a-reg, make sure it is not last.

Sun Apr  2 13:02:26 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* stor-layout.c (agg_mode): Use highest mode that has desired size.
	Allow all integer modes, but reject sizes > MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE.
	(That defaults to the size of DImode.)

Sat Apr  1 00:50:11 1989  Matthew Self  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (convert_move): Modified to use mode classes
	instead of refering to specific machine modes.

	* expr.c (do_jump): Converted to use CONST0_RTX macro.
	do_jmp no longer refers to any machine modes directly except
	for VOIDmode!

	* expr.c (compare, compare1): Modified to use CONST0_RTX
	macro.  No longer refers to any machine modes directly
	except VOIDmode and BLKmode!

	* machmode.def: Documented assumptions made about the order
	of machine modes during mode widening.

	* optabs.c (expand_binop, expand_twoval_binop, expand_unop,
	emit_cmp_insn): Added mode widening which is independent of
	specific machine modes.  It assumes that we may widen to any
	higher numbered mode of the same mode class.
	  NOTE: the checks for VOIDmode ops which were present in
	QI and HI to SI widening are now present in all widening.
	I assume this is correct.  Also, widening is now possible
	from QI to HI.  This may or may not be a good thing....

	(can_eliminate_biv_p, eliminate_biv): Use that field.

	* loop.c (struct iv_class): `init_insn' records what inits the biv.
	Replaces `init_val_set' flag.
	(strength_reduce): Update and test `init_insn' instead.
	Use of a biv between its init and the start of the loop
	does not preclude its elimination from the loop.
	Setting a giv is ok for eliminating a biv, even if giv is "ignore",
	since that just means giv will be combined with another.
	Handle some DEST_ADDR givs for that purpose.
	Test for giv-setting before check can_eliminate_biv_p.
	New error check for replaceable giv whose value needed after loop.
	(only_reg_use_p): New fn.

	* expr.c (expand_expr): PLUS, MINUS with EXPAND_SUM:
	Associate even harder.

	* loop.c (strength_reduce): Treat all constant biv init vals like ints.

	* loop.c (strength_reduce): Clear all_reduced when v->ignore is set;
	the code to check this later didn't always do the job.

	* loop.c (verify_loop): Set loop_continue.
	(scan_loop): mention its value.
	* rtl.h: Define NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT.
	* stmt.c (expand_loop_continue_here): Output one.

	matches it, even for languages not being used.

	* loop.c (loop_optimize, move_movables): when moving a `clr' insn used

	(ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME): Override this.
	(ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC): Override; output nothing.

	call alter_subreg, constrain_operands and NOTICE_UPDATE_CC.
	So callers other than output_eager_then_insn don't lose.
	(output_eager_then_insn): No need to do that stuff.

	* symout.c (symout_block_symbols): Handle (MEM (REG)) for
	variable-sized arrays.

	* tm-encore.h (ASM_SPEC): Always pass -j; avoid jump-range lossage.

	* tm-i386gas.h: Include tm-bsd386.h, not tm-att386.h.

	(eq_or_neq): New fn, for seq/sne recognizers.

	* c-decl.c (grokdeclarator, size of array type):
	Strip from SIZE any NOP_EXPRs that don't change anything.

	* reload.c, recog.c: Include real.h so constraint macros can examine
	CONST_DOUBLEs.

	* expr.c (convert_move): Use extendqidi2, etc. for converting

	[If any of the matched insns is a JUMP_INSN, set want_jump,
	and in that case make the matched peephole a JUMP_INSN itself.]
	That's in an #if 0 now; it's good in jump, but not in final.

	* jump.c (jump_optimize): Don't do peepholes here.
	* final.c (final): Do them here.

	* jump.c (jump_optimize): In optimizing `if (foo) bar; else break;',

	make a COMPOUND_EXPR to ensure the rhs is computed before the branch.
