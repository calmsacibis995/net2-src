Installing GNU CC
*****************

Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a Unix system.

* Menu:

* Other Dir::     Compiling in a separate directory (not where the source is).
* Sun Install::   See below for installation on the Sun.
* 3B1 Install::   See below for installation on the 3B1.
* SCO Install::   See below for installation on SCO System V 3.2.  (Or ESIX.)
* VMS Install::   See below for installation on VMS.
* HPUX Install::  See below for installation on HPUX.
* MIPS Install::  See below for installation on MIPS.
* Tower Install:: See below for installation on an NCR Tower.

  1. Edit `Makefile'.  If you are using HPUX, or any form of system
     V, you must make a few changes described in comments at the
     beginning of the file.  Genix requires changes also, and so does
     the Pyramid.

  2. On a Sequent system, go to the Berkeley universe.

  3. Choose configuration files.  The easy way to do this is to run
     the command file `config.gcc' with a single argument, which
     specifies the type of machine (and in some cases which operating
     system).

     Here is a list of the possible arguments:

    `vax'
          Vaxes running BSD.

    `vms'
          Vaxes running VMS.

    `vax-sysv'
          Vaxes running system V.

    `i386-sysv'
          Intel 386 PCs running system V.

    `i386-sysv-gas'
          Intel 386 PCs running system V, using the GNU assembler and
          GNU linker.

    `sequent-i386'
          Sequent with Intel 386 processors.

    `i386-aix'
          Intel 386 PCs or PS/2s running AIX.

    `sun2'
          Sun 2 running system version 2 or 3.

    `sun3'
          Sun 3 running system version 2 or 3, with 68881.  Note
          there we do not provide a configuration file to use an FPA
          by default, because programs that establish signal handlers
          for floating point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.

    `sun3-nfp'
          Sun 3 running system version 2 or 3, without 68881.

    `sun4'
          Sun 4 running system version 2 or 3.  *Note
          Incompatibilities::, for calling convention
          incompatibilities on the Sun 4 (sparc).

    `sun2-os4'
          Sun 2 running system version 4.

    `sun3-os4'
          Sun 3 running system version 4, with 68881.

    `sun3-nfp-os4'
          Sun 3 running system version 4, without 68881.

    `sun4-os4'
          Sun 4 running system version 4.  *Note Incompatibilities::,
          for calling convention incompatibilities on the Sun 4
          (sparc).

    `sun386'
          Sun 386 ("roadrunner").

    `alliant'
          Alliant FX/8 computer.  Note that the standard installed C
          compiler in Concentrix 5.0 has a bug which prevent it from
          compiling GNU CC correctly.  You can patch the compiler bug
          as follows:

               cp /bin/pcc ./pcc
               adb -w ./pcc - << EOF
               15f6?w 6610
               EOF

          Then you must use the `-ip12' option when compiling GNU CC
          with the patched compiler, as shown here:

               make CC="./pcc -ip12" CFLAGS=-w

          Note also that Alliant's version of DBX does not manage to
          work with the output from GNU CC.

    `tahoe'
          The tahoe computer (running BSD, and using DBX).

    `decstation'
          The DEC 3100 Mips machine ("pmax").  Note that GNU CC
          cannot generate debugging information in the unusual format
          used on the Mips.

    `mips-sysv'
          The Mips computer, RS series, with the System V environment
          as default.  Note that GNU CC cannot generate debugging
          information in the unusual format used on the Mips.

    `mips-bsd43'
          The Mips computer, RS series, with the BSD 4.3 environment
          as default.  Note that GNU CC cannot generate debugging
          information in the unusual format used on the Mips.

    `mips'
          The Mips computer, M series.  Note that GNU CC cannot
          generate debugging information in the unusual format used
          on the Mips.

    `iris'
          Another variant of the Mips computer, the Silicon Graphics
          Iris 4D.  Note that GNU CC cannot generate debugging
          information in the unusual format used on the Mips.

    `convex-c1'
          Convex C1 computer.

    `convex-c2'
          Convex C2 computer.

    `pyramid'
          Pyramid computer.

    `hp9k320'
          HP 9000 series 300 using HPUX assembler.  Note there is no
          support in GNU CC for HP's debugger; thus, `-g' is not
          available in this configuration.

    `hp9k320-gas'
          HP 9000 series 300 using GNU assembler, linker and debugger.
          This requires the HP-adapt package, which is available
          along with the GNU linker as part of the "binutils"
          distribution.  This is on the GNU CC distribution tape.

    `hp9k320-old'
          HP 9000 series 300 using HPUX assembler, in operating
          system versions older than 6.5.  Note there is no support
          in GNU CC for HP's debugger; thus, `-g' is not available in
          this configuration.

    `hp9k320-bsd'
          HP 9000 series 300 running BSD.

    `isi68'
          ISI 68000 or 68020 system with a 68881.

    `isi68-nfp'
          ISI 68000 or 68020 system without a 68881.

    `news800'
          Sony NEWS 68020 system.

    `next'
          NeXT system.

    `tower'
          NCR Tower 32 system.

    `altos'
          Altos 3068.  Note that you must use the GNU assembler,
          linker and debugger, with COFF-encapsulation.  Also, you
          must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file `ALTOS-README'.

    `3b1'
          AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  Note that special procedures are
          needed to compile GNU CC with this machine's standard C
          compiler, due to bugs in that compiler.  *Note 3b1
          Install::.  You can bootstrap it more easily with previous
          versions of GNU CC if you have them.

    `3b1-gas'
          AT&T 3b1 using the GNU assembler.

    `sequent-ns32k'
          Sequent containing ns32000 processors.

    `encore'
          Encore ns32000 system.

    `genix'
          National Semiconductor ns32000 system.

    `88000'
          Motorola 88000 processor.  This port is not finished.

     Here we spell out what files need to be set up:

        * Make a symbolic link named `config.h' to the top-level
          config file for the machine you are using (*note
          Config::.).  This file is responsible for defining
          information about the host machine.  It includes `tm.h'.

          The file is located in the subdirectory `config'.  Its name
          should be `xm-MACHINE.h', with these exceptions:

         `xm-vms.h'
               for vaxen running VMS.

         `xm-vaxv.h'
               for vaxen running system V.

         `xm-i386v.h'
               for Intel 80386's running system V.

         `xm-sun386i.h'
               for Sun roadrunner running any version of the
               operating system.

         `xm-hp9k320.h'
               for the HP 9000 series 300.

         `xm-genix.h'
               for the ns32000 running Genix

          If your system does not support symbolic links, you might
          want to set up `config.h' to contain a `#include' command
          which refers to the appropriate file.

        * Make a symbolic link named `tm.h' to the
          machine-description macro file for your machine.  It should
          be in the subdirectory `config' and its name should be
          `tm-MACHINE.h'.

          If your system is a 68000, don't use the file `tm-m68k.h'
          directly.  Instead, use one of these files:

         `tm-sun3.h'
               for Sun 3 machines with 68881.

         `tm-sun3-nfp.h'
               for Sun 3 machines with no hardware floating point.

         `tm-sun3os3.h'
               for Sun 3 machines with 68881, running Sunos version 3.

         `tm-sun3os3nf.h'
               for Sun 3 machines with no hardware floating point,
               running Sunos version 3.

         `tm-sun2.h'
               for Sun 2 machines.

         `tm-3b1.h'
               for AT&T 3b1 (aka 7300 Unix PC).

         `tm-isi68.h'
               for Integrated Solutions systems.  This file assumes
               you use the GNU assembler.

         `tm-isi68-nfp.h'
               for Integrated Solutions systems without a 68881. 
               This file assumes you use the GNU assembler.

         `tm-news800.h'
               for Sony NEWS systems.

         `tm-hp9k320.h'
               for HPUX systems, if you are using GNU CC with the
               system's assembler and linker.

         `tm-hp9k320g.h'
               for HPUX systems, if you are using the GNU assembler,
               linker and other utilities.  Not all of the pieces of
               GNU software needed for this mode of operation are as
               yet in distribution; full instructions will appear
               here in the future.

         `tm-tower-as.h'
               for NCR Tower 32 systems, using the standard system
               assembler.

          For the vax, use `tm-vax.h' on BSD Unix, `tm-vaxv.h' on
          system V, or `tm-vms.h' on VMS.

          For the Motorola 88000, use `tm-m88k.h'.  The support for
          the 88000 does not currently work; it requires extensive
          changes which we hope to reconcile in version 2.

          For the 80386, don't use `tm-i386.h' directly.  Use
          `tm-i386v.h' if the target machine is running system V,
          `tm-i386gas.h' if it is running system V but you are using
          the GNU assembler and linker, `tm-seq386.h' for a Sequent
          386 system, or `tm-compaq.h' for a Compaq, or
          `tm-sun386i.h' for a Sun 386 system.

          For the Mips computer, there are five choices: `tm-mips.h'
          for the M series, `tm-mips-bsd.h' for the RS series with
          BSD, `tm-mips-sysv.h' for the RS series with System V,
          `tm-iris.h' for the Iris version of the machine, and
          `tm-decstatn.h' for the Decstation.

          For the 32000, use `tm-sequent.h' if you are using a
          Sequent machine, or `tm-encore.h' for an Encore machine, or
          `tm-genix.h' if you are using Genix version 3; otherwise,
          perhaps `tm-ns32k.h' will work for you.

          Note that Genix has bugs in `alloca' and `malloc'; you must
          get the compiled versions of these from GNU Emacs and edit
          GNU CC's `Makefile' to use them.

          Note that Encore systems are supported only under BSD.

          For Sparc (Sun 4) machines, use `tm-sparc.h' with operating
          system version 4, and `tm-sun4os3.h' with system version 3.

          For Convex systems before version 8.1, use `tm-conv1os7.h'
          or `tm-conv2os7.h'.  For versions 8.1 and greater, use
          `tm-convex1.h' or `tm-convex2.h'.  You should also
          bootstrap GCC with `pcc' rather than `cc'; one way to do
          this is with the following commands.

               ln -s /bin/pcc ./cc
               set path = (. $path)

        * Make a symbolic link named `md' to the machine description
          pattern file.  It should be in the `config' subdirectory
          and its name should be `MACHINE.md'; but MACHINE is often
          not the same as the name used in the `tm.h' file because
          the `md' files are more general.

        * Make a symbolic link named `aux-output.c' to the output
          subroutine file for your machine.  It should be in the
          `config' subdirectory and its name should be `out-MACHINE.c'.

  4. Make sure the Bison parser generator is installed.  (This is
     unnecessary if the Bison output files `c-parse.tab.c' and
     `cexp.c' are more recent than `c-parse.y' and `cexp.y' and you
     do not plan to change the `.y' files.)

     Bison versions older than Sept 8, 1988 will produce incorrect
     output for `c-parse.tab.c'.

  5. If you have a previous version of GCC installed, then chances
     are you can compile the new version with that.  Do the following:

          make CC="gcc -O"

     Since this produces an optimized executable right away, there is
     no need to bootstrap the result with itself except to test it. 
     Therefore, you can skip directly to the `make install' step below.

  6. Build the compiler.  Just type `make' in the compiler directory.

     Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
     the `insn-emit.c'; they are normal.  Any other compilation
     errors may represent bugs in the port to your machine or
     operating system, and should be investigated and reported (*note
     Bugs::.).

     Some commercial compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they
     have bugs or limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler
     is said to run out of macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run
     out of expression space; then you need to break up the statement
     where the problem happens.

  7. If you are using COFF-encapsulation, you must convert `gnulib'
     to a GNU-format library at this point.  See the file
     `README-ENCAP' in the directory containing the GNU binary file
     utilities, for directions.

  8. Move the first-stage object files and executables into a
     subdirectory with this command:

          make stage1

     The files are moved into a subdirectory named `stage1'.  Once
     installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files
     with `rm -r stage1'.

  9. Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:

          make CC=stage1/gcc CFLAGS="-g -O -Bstage1/"

     This is called making the stage 2 compiler.

     On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware,
     unless you have selected a `tm.h' file that expects by default
     that there is no such hardware, do this instead:

          make CC=stage1/gcc CFLAGS="-g -O -Bstage1/ -msoft-float"

 10. If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one
     more time, do this (in C shell):

          make stage2
          make CC=stage2/gcc CFLAGS="-g -O -Bstage2/"
          foreach file (*.o)
          cmp $file stage2/$file
          end

     This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the `-B'
     option, the options should be the same as when you made the
     stage 2 compiler.

     The `foreach' command (written in C shell) will notify you if
     any of these stage 3 object files differs from those of stage 2.
     On BSD systems, any difference, no matter how innocuous,
     indicates that the stage 2 compiler has compiled GNU CC
     incorrectly, and is therefore a potentially serious bug which
     you should investigate and report (*note Bugs::.).

     On systems that use COFF object files, bytes 5 to 8 will always
     be different, since it is a timestamp.  On these systems, you
     can do the comparison as follows (in Bourne shell):

          for file in *.o; do
          echo $file
          tail +10c $file > foo1
          tail +10c stage2/$file > foo2
          cmp foo1 foo2
          done

     On MIPS machines, you should use the shell script `ecoff-cmp' to
     compare two object files.

 11. Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time
     support.  You can use the following command:

          make install

     This copies the files `cc1', `cpp' and `gnulib' to files
     `gcc-cc1', `gcc-cpp' and `gcc-gnulib' in directory
     `/usr/local/lib', which is where the compiler driver program
     looks for them.  It also copies the driver program `gcc' into
     the directory `/usr/local/bin', so that it appears in typical
     execution search paths.

     *Warning: there is a bug in `alloca' in the Sun library.  To
     avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were
     compiled by GNU CC.  They use `alloca' as a built-in function
     and never the one in the library.*

     *Warning: the GNU CPP may not work for `ioctl.h', `ttychars.h'
     and other system header files unless the `-traditional' option
     is used.*  The bug is in the header files: at least on some
     machines, they rely on behavior that is incompatible with ANSI
     C.  This behavior consists of substituting for macro argument
     names when they appear inside of character constants.  The
     `-traditional' option tells GNU CC to behave the way these
     headers expect.

     Because of this problem, you might prefer to configure GNU CC to
     use the system's own C preprocessor.  To do so, make the file
     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-cpp' a link to `/lib/cpp'.

     Alternatively, on Sun systems and 4.3BSD at least, you can
     correct the include files by running the shell script
     `fixincludes'.  This installs modified, corrected copies of the
     files `ioctl.h', `ttychars.h' and many others, in a special
     directory where only GNU CC will normally look for them.  This
     script will work on various systems because it chooses the files
     by searching all the system headers for the problem cases that
     we know about.

     Use the following command to do this:

          make includes

     If you selected a different directory for GNU CC installation
     when you installed it, by specifying the Make variable `prefix'
     or `libdir', specify it the same way in this command.

     Note that some systems are starting to come with ANSI C system
     header files.  On these systems, don't run `fixincludes'; it may
     not work, and is certainly not necessary.

If you cannot install the compiler's passes and run-time support in
`/usr/local/lib', you can alternatively use the `-B' option to
specify a prefix by which they may be found.  The compiler
concatenates the prefix with the names  `cpp', `cc1' and `gnulib'. 
Thus, you can put the files in a directory `/usr/foo/gcc' and specify
`-B/usr/foo/gcc/' when you run GNU CC.

Also, you can specify an alternative default directory for these
files by setting the Make variable `libdir' when you make GNU CC.

Compilation in a Separate Directory
===================================

If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
do differently:

  1. Go to that directory before running `config.gcc':

          mkdir gcc-sun3
          cd gcc-sun3

     On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory
     must be on the same file system as the source code directory.

  2. Specify where to find `config.gcc' when you run it:

          ../gcc-1.36/config.gcc ...

  3. Specify where to find the sources, as an argument to `config.gcc':

          ../gcc-1.36/config.gcc -srcdir=../gcc-1.36 sun3

     The `-srcdir=DIR' option is not needed when the source directory
     is the parent of the current directory, because `config.gcc'
     detects that case automatically.

Now, you can run `make' in that directory.  You need not repeat the
configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change. 
You must, however, run `config.gcc' again when the configuration
files change, if your system does not support symbolic links.

Installing GNU CC on the Sun
============================

Make sure the environment variable `FLOAT_OPTION' is not set when you
compile `gnulib'.  If this option were set to `f68881' when `gnulib'
is compiled, the resulting code would demand to be linked with a
special startup file and would not link properly without special
pains.

There is a bug in `alloca' in certain versions of the Sun library. 
To avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were compiled
by GNU CC.  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never the
one in the library.

Some versions of the Sun compiler crash when compiling GNU CC, with a
segmentation fault in cpp.  This can sometimes be due to the bulk of
data in the environment variables.  You may be able to avoid it by
using the following command to compile GNU CC with Sun CC:

     make CC="TERMCAP=x OBJS=x LIBFUNCS=x STAGESTUFF=x cc"

Another problem that often happens on Suns is that you get a crash
when building stage 2, when `genflags' is run.

One reason for such as crash is if you configured GNU CC for the
wrong version of SunOS.  Starting with version 1.38, configurations
`sun3' and `sun4' are for SunOS 4, so this problem should no longer
happen.

Another cause of the same symptom is having installed the GNU linker
with an earlier version of SunOS.  The version that worked before
stopped working due to a change in the format of executables in SunOS
4.1.  Many sites have installed the GNU linker as
`/usr/local/lib/gcc-ld', often as part of installing GNU C++.  So if
you get such crashes and you have used the proper configuration, try
deleting `/usr/local/lib/gcc-ld'.

The current version of the GNU linker, found in the current binutils
release, does work with SunOS 4.1.

Installing GNU CC on the 3b1
============================

Installing GNU CC on the 3b1 is difficult if you do not already have
GNU CC running, due to bugs in the installed C compiler.  However,
the following procedure might work.  We are unable to test it.

  1. Comment out the `#include "config.h"' line on line 37 of
     `cccp.c' and do `make cpp'.  This makes a preliminary version of
     GNU cpp.

  2. Save the old `/lib/cpp' and copy the preliminary GNU cpp to that
     file name.

  3. Undo your change in `cccp.c', or reinstall the original version,
     and do `make cpp' again.

  4. Copy this final version of GNU cpp into `/lib/cpp'.

  5. Replace every occurrence of `obstack_free' in `tree.c' with
     `_obstack_free'.

  6. Run `make' to get the first-stage GNU CC.

  7. Reinstall the original version of `/lib/cpp'.

  8. Now you can compile GNU CC with itself and install it in the
     normal fashion.

If you have installed an earlier version of GCC, you can compile the
newer version with that.  However, you will run into trouble
compiling `gnulib', since that is normally compiled with CC.  To
solve the problem, uncomment this line in `Makefile':

     CCLIBFLAGS = -B/usr/local/lib/gcc- -tp -Wp,-traditional

Installing GNU CC on SCO System V 3.2
=====================================

The compiler that comes with this system does not work properly with
`-O'.  Therefore, you should redefine the Make variable `CCLIBFLAGS'
not to use `-O'.

You should also edit `Makefile' to enable the lines that set `CLIB'
to `-lPW', and the ones specifically labeled as being for SCO, that
set `RANLIB', and that set `CC' and `OLDCC' to `rcc'.

Also, edit the definition of `USER_H' to remove the file `limits.h'.

Then you can run `config.gcc i386-sco' and finish building GNU CC
normally.

The same recipe should work on ESIX, but use `config.gcc i386-esix'
instead.

Installing GNU CC on VMS
========================

The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset
containing both source code and precompiled binaries.

To install the `gcc' command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the
VMS CLD file for GNU CC as follows:

  1. Define the VMS logical names `GNU_CC' and `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to
     point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
     (`gcc-cpp', `gcc-cc1', etc.) and the C include files are kept. 
     This should be done with the commands:

          $ assign /super /system disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
          $ assign /super /system disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands
     can be placed in your system startup file so they will be
     executed whenever the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you
     choose, do this via the `GCC_INSTALL.COM' script in the `[GCC]'
     directory.

  2. Install the `GCC' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$library:dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc

  3. To install the help file, do the following:

          $ lib/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp

     Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like `gcc
     /verbose file.c', which is equivalent to the command `gcc -v -c
     file.c' in Unix.

We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS
distribution tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older
version that the sources, because we don't always have time to update
them.  (Use the `/verbose' option to determine the version number of
the binaries and compare it with the source file `version.c' to tell
whether this is so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you
get to recompile the sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:

  1. Copy the file `tm-vms.h' to `tm.h', `xm-vms.h' to `config.h',
     `vax.md' to `md.' and `out-vax.c' to `aux-output.c'.  The files
     to be copied are found in the subdirectory named `config'; they
     should be copied to the main directory of GNU CC.

  2. Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
     addition, define the vms logical name `GNU_BISON' to point at
     the to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This
     should be done with the command:

          $ assign /super /system disk:[bison.] gnu_bison

     You may, if you choose, use the `INSTALL_BISON.COM' script in
     the `[BISON]' directory.

  3. Install the `BISON' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$library:dcltables gnu_bison:[000000]bison

  4. Type `@make' to do recompile everything.

     If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33,
     specify `/DEFINE=("inline=")' as an option in all the
     compilations.  This requires editing all the `gcc' commands in
     `make-cc1.com'.  (The older versions had problems supporting
     `inline'.)  Once you have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you
     can change this file back.

With this version of GNU CC, `const' global variables now work
properly.  Unless, however, the `const' modifier is also specified in
every external declaration of the variable in all of the source files
that use that variable, the linker will issue warnings about
conflicting attributes for the variable, since the linker does not
know if the variable should be read-only.  The program will still
work, but the variable will be placed in writable storage.

Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would
occasionally give strange results when linked to the sharable
`VAXCRTL' library.  Now this should work.

Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked
to the sharable `VAXCRTL', unless you force the linker to use the
`qsort' routine from `gcclib.olb'.  The `qsort' routine supplied with
`VAXCRTL' has a bug which causes a compiler crash.  The executable
that is generated by `make-cc1.com' uses the non-shared version of
`VAXCRTL' (and thus the `qsort' routine from `gcclib.olb').

Note that GNU CC on VMS now generates debugging information to
describe the programs symbols to the VMS debugger.  However, you need
version 1.37 or later of GAS in order to output them properly in the
object file.

Installing GNU CC on HPUX
=========================

To install GNU CC on HPUX, you must start by editing the file
`Makefile'.  Search for the string `HPUX' to find comments saying
what to change.  You need to change some variable definitions and (if
you are using GAS) some lines in the rule for the target `gnulib'.

To avoid errors when linking programs with `-g', create an empty
library named `libg.a'.  An easy way to do this is:

     ar rc /usr/local/lib/libg.a

To compile with the HPUX C compiler, you must specify get the file
`alloca.c' from GNU Emacs.  Then, when you run `make', use this
argument:

     make ALLOCA=alloca.o

When recompiling GNU CC with itself, do not define `ALLOCA'. 
Instead, an `-I' option needs to be added to `CFLAGS' as follows:

     make CC=stage1/gcc CFLAGS="-g -O -Bstage1/ -I../binutils/hp-include"

Installing GNU CC on MIPS

To avoid errors when linking programs with `-g', create an empty

Installing GNU CC on an NCR Tower
=================================

On an NCR Tower model 4x0 or 6x0, you may have trouble because the
default maximum virtual address size of a process is just 1 Mb.  Most
often you will find this problem while compiling GNU CC with itself.

The only way to solve the problem is to reconfigure the kernel.  Add
a line such as this to the configuration file:

     MAXUMEM = 4096

and then relink the kernel and reboot the machine.
