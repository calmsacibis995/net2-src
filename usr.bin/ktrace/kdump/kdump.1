.Dt KDUMP 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kdump
.Op Fl dnlRT
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl t Op cnis
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Kdump
displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human readable format.
By default, the file ``ktrace.out'' in the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
.Tc Fl f
.Ws
.Ar file
.Cx
Display the specified file instead of ``ktrace.out''.
.Tp Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.Tc Fl m
.Ws
.Ar maxdata
.Cx
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding I/O.
.Tp Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm kdump
tries to decode many system calls into a more human readable format.
For example, ioctl values are replaced with the macro name and errno
values are replaced with the
.Li strerror()
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.Tp Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.Tp Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.Tc Fl t
.Ws
.Ar cnis
.Cx
See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1 .
