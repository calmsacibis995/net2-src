        * Added the `-h' option to print out a verbose help message.

        * Added a check in Trie::output that ensures the program doesn't
          crash if no keywords are given!
          
        * Implemented the -f (generate full trie) option.  This is useful
          to generate another example program for my USENIX C++ paper!

        * Removed the member field `compact_output' from class Trie.  
          Changed all uses of this variable to option[COMPACT].  Why
          was it ever done the other way anyhow?!

        * Added the `-C' CONST option so that user's can declare strings in 
          the generated lookup table to be readonly.

        * Killed some debugging code in compact.cc (operator new).

        * Fixed a bunch of incredibly stupid errors.  (I can't believe
          this thing even worked before...).  That's what happens when you
          don't hack for 2 months ;-(
