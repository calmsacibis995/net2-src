.Nm kill
.Op Fl signal_number
.Ar pid

The kill utility sends the TERM signal to the processes specified
by the pid operand(s).

.Pp
.Tw Ds

of the default TERM.
.Tp

Some of the more commonly used signals:
.Ds I
.Cw XXX TERM
.Cl -1	-1	(broadcast to all processes, super-user only)
.Cl 0	0	(sh(1) only, signals all members of process group)
.Cl 2	INT	(interupt)
.Cl 3	QUIT	(quit)
.Cl 6	ABRT	(abort)

.Nm Kill
is a built-in to
.Xr csh  1  ;
it allows job specifiers of the form ``%...'' as arguments
so process id's are not as often used as
.Nm kill
arguments.
See
.Xr csh  1
for details.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigvec 2
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm kill
command appeared in Version 6 AT&T Unix.
.Sh BUGS
A replacement for
.Dq Li kill 0
for
.Xr csh  1
users should be provided.
