This is a simple attempt at a port of the "simple" nfs test suite to the
macintosh.  It is intended to be compiled with the LightSpeed v3.0 C
compiler on the Macintosh.

The tar file contains the source files. Any files with resource forks
are invalid. The tar program I used only deals with data forks.

The "Mac-Cthon.sit" is a binary data file created by "stuffit" which
contains the files with resource forks.

To unpack this:

1. find a copy of binhex, stuffit or what ever will unpack a ".hqx" file

2. copy the the three ".hqx" files, the ".sit" file and the ".tar" file
to your macintosh. You can use NCSA telnet's ftp, aufs, or whatever

3. "binhex" the tar.hqx and stuffit.hqx files. This will create two
new applications, "tar" and "stuffit"

4. Run tar and "extract" the ".tar" file. This will unpack the source files

5. Move the ".sit" file into the folder ("Mac-Connectathon") created by
tar when you extracted the files. (step 4 above)

6. Run stuffit on the ".sit" file (double click on the ".sit" file or
run stuffit and select "open" and select the ".sit" file)

7. extract all of the files in the ".sit" file

8. At this point you should be able to run the executable ("basic-test-0.24")
or run the LightSpeed project and change the source/

---

The test will pop up an "SFPutFile" dialog when you first run it.
Press the "drive" button to select the volume you wish to exercise
(most likely, your nfs volume)

After that, the test is on auto pilot.  Selecting individual tests
is done by changing the source code. Take a look at main.c; there is a
simple macro to turn tests on and off.
